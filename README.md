## Features

MinimalAIChat is a native iOS 15 application built to replace clunky web interfaces for AI services like Gemini or ChatGPT, ensuring older devices can still leverage modern LLMs.

* 🚀 **Ultra-lightweight:** Built with native SwiftUI and minimal dependencies for excellent performance on older devices.
* 💾 **Local History:** All your conversations are saved locally and securely on your device.
* 💬 **Proactive Chat:** The current AI persona can generate a future message from recent conversation context and deliver it through an iOS local notification without waiting for the user to speak first.
* 🇨🇳 **Chinese Proactive Messages:** Proactive messages can be generated in Simplified Chinese or English.
* 🧹 **Smart Auto-Cleanup:** Empty or accidental sessions are automatically cleared on the next app launch, keeping your sidebar clutter-free.
* 🔒 **Privacy First:** API calls travel directly from your phone to the provider. No intermediate servers, proxies, or data logging.
* 🔎 **Web Search (optional):** Let the AI search the web for current information — news, recent events, anything past its training cutoff — using [Tavily](https://tavily.com). Works with any provider. The AI decides on its own when a search is actually needed.

## Requirements

* **An iPhone running iOS 15.0** or higher.
* **A valid API key** from a compatible provider (OpenAI, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, etc.). The app utilizes a standard OpenAI-compatible "Chat Completions" endpoint format.
* *(Optional)* A free [Tavily](https://tavily.com) API key if you want the AI to be able to search the web — see [Enabling Web Search](#enabling-web-search-optional) below.

## Installation

Since this app is **not available on the App Store**, you will need to sideload it. The .ipa file provided in the [Releases](../../releases) section is unsigned and ready for either of the methods below.

You can also open the repository's **Actions** tab, run **Build Unsigned IPA**, and download the `MinimalAIChat-unsigned-ipa` artifact after the workflow completes. The artifact must still be signed by TrollStore, AltStore, Sideloadly, or another compatible signing method before installation.

### Option 1: TrollStore (Recommended)
If your device is running **iOS 14.0 through iOS 17.0**:
1. Install [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore) on your device.
2. Download MinimalAIChat.ipa from the Releases tab and open it with TrollStore.
3. Click install. The app will remain permanently signed on your device without expiring.

### Option 2: AltStore / Sideloadly
Works on **any current iOS version**, as these tools sign the app using your personal Apple ID:
1. Install [AltStore](https://altstore.io) or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io) on your computer.
2. Connect your iPhone and follow the respective tool's guide to install MinimalAIChat.ipa.
3. *Note:* Free Apple ID developer certificates expire every 7 days and require a manual or automated refresh. Paid Apple Developer accounts last for 1 year.

## Proactive Chat

1. Open **Settings → 主动聊天与通知**.
2. Enable **主动聊天** and allow notification permission.
3. Choose Chinese or English and select the delay before the next message.
4. Keep the app open briefly so the current persona can generate the next message from the latest conversation.
5. iOS delivers the message as a local notification at the selected time. Opening the app imports that message into the original chat session.

Because iOS does not allow ordinary apps to run unrestricted AI requests indefinitely in the background, the next message is generated while the app is active and scheduled in advance. This does not require a push server.

## How to Obtain an API Key

The app supports any provider that uses the standard "Chat Completions" endpoint layout. Here is how to get a key from the most popular services:

### Google Gemini
1. Navigate to [aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. Sign in with your Google account and accept the terms.
3. Click **Create API key**.
4. *Cost:* Offers a generous free tier with daily rate limits.

### OpenAI (GPT)
1. Navigate to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
2. Log in or create an account (*Note: This is separate from a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which does not grant API access*).
3. Click **Create new secret key** and copy it immediately (it won't be shown again).
4. *Cost:* You must add a payment method under **Billing** to fund your API usage balance.

### OpenRouter
An excellent choice if you want access to a variety of open-source and proprietary models (Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, etc.) using a single key:
1. Navigate to [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys).
2. Create an account and add a small balance.
3. Click **Create Key**.

> ⚠️ **Security Warning:** Never share your API key publicly or commit it to a public repository. MinimalAIChat stores your key securely inside the iOS Keychain; it is never saved in plaintext and is only used for direct, local requests to your chosen provider.

## Enabling Web Search (Optional)

MinimalAIChat can let the AI search the web for current information — news, recent events, or anything past its training cutoff — using [Tavily](https://tavily.com), a search API built for AI apps. This works with **any** provider (Gemini, OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc.), not just one.

1. Go to [tavily.com](https://tavily.com) and create a free account.
2. Copy your API key from the Tavily dashboard.
3. In MinimalAIChat, paste it during onboarding, or later under **Settings → Advanced → Web Search (Tavily)**.
4. *Cost:* Tavily's free tier includes 1,000 searches per month — more than enough for personal use.

Once set, the AI will automatically search the web on its own whenever a question needs up-to-date information — you don't need to trigger it manually. Leave the field empty if you don't want this feature; the app works exactly the same without it.

> ⚠️ Same security note as above applies: your Tavily key is stored in the iOS Keychain, never in plaintext, and is only used for direct requests to Tavily's API.
